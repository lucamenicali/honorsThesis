This paper investigates volatility and fiscal policy when the government of a small-open economy leaves a monetary union. The paper builds a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model for a small-open economy without monetary policy independence and solves it to find the optimal simple fiscal rules that minimize the volatility of output, inflation, the interest rate, and the exchange rate. Exit from a monetary union is modeled by adding two key features to the underlying model: an endogenously-determined interest rate following a Taylor Rule and a floating exchange rate by imposing the uncovered interest rate parity condition. The paper draws policy-relevant conclusions by comparing fiscal rules before the small-open economy leaves the monetary union and after. Results show that upon exit from a monetary union, every fiscal instrument, with the exception of the income tax, is more responsive to gaps in government liabilities and output, as well as that the level of volatility in the economy increases. This is due to the presence of a floating exchange rate and its effects are two sided: 1) volatility in the domestic currency increases the volatility of interest rate and 2) the presence of a floating exchange rate creates a relationship between interest rate an government liabilities, which directly impacts fiscal policy.
